title: About
---

I started this site to try Next.js 13 and the new app directory.
To get to know the new version of the framework properly,
I decided not to write another demo application, but to start a blog.
In this blog I wanted to describe all the challenges
I had to overcome during the development of the blog itself.

## Tech Stack

The first thing I did was set the rest of the tech stack alongside Next.js.

### PnPM

I choose [PnPM](https://pnpm.io/) over [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/),
because at the time I made the decision, [PnPM](https://pnpm.io/) was the fastest package manager, and the most efficient at using disk space.

### TypeScript

Before I got into frontend development,
I worked almost exclusively with statically typed languages (mostly Java).
So working with JavaScript was a bit difficult for me,
especially refactoring was pretty scary for me.
I feel much more at home with TypeScript and the DX is so much better.

### TailwindCSS

I love writing styles in TailwindCSS,
mainly because it takes the burden off me to come up with names for everything.
With utility classes, there's no need for all the naming of classes and variants.
I also find it much easier if everything that belongs to a component (logic, markup and styles) is in one file.

### MDX

Writing content in Markdown is much easier than writing in JSX,
but sometimes you still want to include a dynamic component and
that is the perfect use case for MDX.

### Contentlayer
