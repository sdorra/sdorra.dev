title: About

I started this site to try Next.js 13 and the new app directory.
To get to know the new version of the framework properly,
I decided not to write another demo application, but to start a blog.
In this blog I wanted to describe all the challenges
I had to overcome during the development of the blog itself.

## Tech Stack

The first thing I did was set the rest of the tech stack alongside Next.js.

### PnPM

I choose [PnPM](https://pnpm.io/) over [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/),
because at the time I made the decision, [PnPM](https://pnpm.io/) was the fastest package manager, and the most efficient at using disk space.

### TypeScript
### TailwindCSS
### Contentlayer
### MDX
### Headless UI
### Ladle
