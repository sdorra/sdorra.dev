A good blog needs an RSS feed, even if hardly anyone seems to use an RSS reader anymore.
This article will explain how to create a RSS feed for a static blog.
In this example we will use [contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/),
but it should work with other data sources too.

## Feed generator

First we need a script to create the feed from our posts.
The script will load the generated posts from the contentlayer directory.

```js scripts/rss.mjs
import { allPosts } from "../.contentlayer/generated/index.mjs";
```

I had to specify the whole path including the extension, otherwise node threw errors at me.

After that we use the [feed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/feed) library to create the feed and
to convert our posts into RSS items.
First we have to install the library and install [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) as well.
We need [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) later to simplify working with dates.

<CH.Code>

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -D feed date-fns
```

```bash yarn
yarn add -D feed date-fns
```

```bash npm
npm install --save-dev feed date-fns
```

</CH.Code>

Than we can create the feed and specify some information about our blog e.g.:

* title
* description
* url
* language

This could look as follows.

```js scripts/rss.mjs
import { Feed } from "feed";

const feed = new Feed({
  title: "Example blog",
  description: "Description for the awesome example blog",
  id: "https://blog.example.com",
  link: "https://blog.example.com",
  language: "en",
  favicon: "https://blog.example.com/favicon.ico",
  copyright: "All rights reserved 2022, Your Name",
  author: {
    name: "Your Name",
    email: "your.name@exmaple.com",
    link: "https://blog.example.com",
  },
});
```

Now we can convert our blog posts to feed items.
We start by sorting the posts by their date.
Then we convert each post to a RSS item and add it to the feed.

```js scripts/rss.mjs
import { compareDesc, parseISO } from "date-fns";

allPosts
  .sort((a, b) => compareDesc(new Date(a.date), new Date(b.date)))
  .forEach((post) => {
    const url = `https://example.com/posts/${post._raw.flattenedPath}`;
    feed.addItem({
      id: url,
      link: url,
      title: post.title,
      description: post.summary,
      date: parseISO(post.date),
      category: post.tags.map((name) => ({ name })),
      image: post.coverImage,
      author: [{
        name: "Your Name",
        email: "your.name@exmaple.com",
        link: "https://blog.example.com",
      }],
    });
  });
```

The feed does not contain the content of our posts. If we want to include the content we can attach it as HTML.
Now we should have everything in place and we can write the feed to the public directory:

```js scripts/rss.mjs
import { writeFileSync } from "fs";

writeFileSync("./public/rss.xml", feed.rss2(), { encoding: "utf-8" })
```

The complete script should like the following.

```js scripts/rss.mjs
import { compareDesc, parseISO } from "date-fns";
import { Feed } from "feed";
import { writeFileSync } from "fs";
import { allPosts } from "../.contentlayer/generated/index.mjs";

const feed = new Feed({
  title: "Example blog",
  description: "Description for the awesome example blog",
  id: "https://blog.example.com",
  link: "https://blog.example.com",
  language: "en",
  favicon: "https://blog.example.com/favicon.ico",
  copyright: "All rights reserved 2022, Your Name",
  author: {
    name: "Your Name",
    email: "your.name@exmaple.com",
    link: "https://blog.example.com",
  },
});

allPosts
  .sort((a, b) => compareDesc(new Date(a.date), new Date(b.date)))
  .forEach((post) => {
    const url = `https://example.com/posts/${post._raw.flattenedPath}`;
    feed.addItem({
      id: url,
      link: url,
      title: post.title,
      description: post.summary,
      date: parseISO(post.date),
      category: post.tags.map((name) => ({ name })),
      image: post.coverImage,
      author: [{
        name: "Your Name",
        email: "your.name@exmaple.com",
        link: "https://blog.example.com",
      }],
    });
  });

writeFileSync("./public/rss.xml", feed.rss2(), { encoding: "utf-8" });
```

## Discoverability

In order for RSS readers to find our feed, we can help them with a `link` tag in the `head` of our page.
For Next.js 13 and the app directory, the root layout is the right place for the `link` tag, since that is how it's included in every page.

```tsx app/layout.tsx focus=6
import { FC, PropsWithChildren } from "react";

const RootLayout: FC<PropsWithChildren> = ({ children }) => (
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="example.com rss feed" href="/rss.xml" />
    </head>
    <body>{children}</body>
  </html>
);

export default RootLayout;
```

## Build

Now it's time to add our feed generator to the build:

```json package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build && node scripts/rss.mjs"
  }
}
```

Whenever our page is build using the `build` script, our RSS feed gets build afterwards.
The order is important, because [contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) have to run first in order to generate the posts.

## Git

Because our RSS feed is generated, we should exclude it from our repository:

```text .gitignore focus=4
/node_modules
/.next/
.contentlayer
public/rss.xml
```

If we would not do that, we would see changes to the `rss.xml` every time we work on our posts.
