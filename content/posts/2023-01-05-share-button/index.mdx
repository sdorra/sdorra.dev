In this article we will create a button, which makes it easy for our readers to share our articles.
We all know the share button on our phones,
which allows us to send a piece of information from an app to one of our contacts via messenger, email, etc.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we could include a button like this on our blog as well.
It turns out we can.
The [Web Share API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Share_API) allows us to open the well known share menu on our phones.
The example below shows a simple example in react.

```tsx
type Props = {
  title: string;
  text: string;
  url: string;
};

const ShareButton = ({ title, text, url }: Props) => {
  const onClick = async () => {
    await window.navigator.share({
      title,
      text,
      url,
    });
  };
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Share</button>;
};
```

Quite simple, isn't it.

## Support

It could be so simple if desktop operating systems and browsers also had a share menu.
But sadly this is not yet the case.
So we have to implement a fallback for those which do not have a share menu.
We can check if the browser supports sharing our kind of information with the following function.

```tsx
const isWebShareSupported = (data: ShareData) => {
  return window.navigator.canShare && window.navigator.share && window.navigator.canShare(data);
};
```

The function will check if the browser has an implementation of the `canShare` and `share` function.
It will also check with `canShare` if the api is able to share our information.
If this function returns `false`, we should display a fallback instead.

## Fallback

For the fallback we could open a modal, with some options to share the article e.g.:

- [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com)
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)

All of these services are popular for sharing information and they all offer a url to simplify this process.
In addition to the services we could add a share with email link and a copy to clipboard function.

For the modal we will use [headlessui](https://headlessui.com/react/dialog),
because it makes it easy for us to implement the modal and we can style it how we want.
Furthermore [headlessui](https://headlessui.com) will handle the accessibility attributes and functions for us,
which are quite complicated for modals.

First we have to install [headlessui](https://headlessui.com).

<CH.Code>

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @headlessui/react
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @headlessui/react
```

```bash npm
npm install @headlessui/react
```

</CH.Code>

Ok, now we are able to open the modal if the [Web Share API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Share_API) is not supported.

```tsx
import { Dialog } from "@headlessui/react";
import { useState } from "react";

type Props = {
  title: string;
  text: string;
  url: string;
};

const ShareButton = ({ title, text, url }: Props) => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

  const onClick = async () => {
    const data = {
      title,
      text,
      url,
    };
    if (isWebShareSupported(data)) {
      await window.navigator.share();
    } else {
      setIsOpen(true);
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={onClick}>Share</button>
      <Dialog open={isOpen} onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)}>
        <Dialog.Panel>
          <Dialog.Title>Share article</Dialog.Title>
          {/* TODO add share links */}
        </Dialog.Panel>
      </Dialog>
    </>
  );
};
```

With this modification,
we check on every click on the button if we are able to use the [Web Share API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Share_API).
If the api is supported we open the native share menu,
if not we set an internal state to open the modal.
We are now ready to add some links.

### Pocket

[Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) is a social bookmarking service for storing, sharing, and discovering web bookmarks.
[Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) has a special link for sharing buttons.
Our implementation could look like the following.

```tsx
import { Pocket } from "lucide-react";

type Props = {
  url: string;
};

const PocketLink = ({ url }: Props) => (
  <a href={`https://getpocket.com/save?url=${encodeURIComponent(url)}`} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
    <Pocket /> Pocket
  </a>
);
```

We use the [lucide-react](https://lucide.dev/docs/lucide-react) to render a nice icon for the [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) link.

### Twitter

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/) is a social networking service that probably everyone has heard of.
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/) has also a special link,
which is able to pre-fill the tweet editor.

```tsx
import { Twitter } from "lucide-react";

type Props = {
  title: string;
  url: string;
};

const TwitterLink = ({ url, title }: Props) => (
  <a
    href={`https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=${encodeURIComponent(url)}&text=${encodeURIComponent(title)}`}
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
  >
    <Twitter /> Twitter
  </a>
);
```

### Facebook

[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) is another quite popular social media network,
with a link which pre-fills the post editor.

```tsx
import { Facebook } from "lucide-react";

type Props = {
  url: string;
};

const FacebookLink = ({ url }: Props) => (
  <a href={`https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=${encodeURIComponent(url)}`} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
    <Facebook /> Facebook
  </a>
);
```

### LinkedIn

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) is another social media network with a business focus.
They also have a share link.

```tsx
import { Linkedin } from "lucide-react";

type Props = {
  url: string;
};

const LinkedInLink = ({ url }: Props) => (
  <a
    href={`https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=${encodeURIComponent(url)}`}
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
  >
    <Linkedin /> LinkedIn
  </a>
);
```

### Email

Another simple option to share an article is to send the url per email.
Here is how we can provide a button, which opens the email client with a prepared email.

```tsx
import { Mail } from "lucide-react";

type Props = {
  title: string;
  text: string;
  url: string;
};

const MailToLink = ({ url, title, text }: Props) => (
  <a
    href={`mailto:?subject=${encodeURIComponent(title)}&body=${encodeURIComponent(text + "\n\n")}${encodeURIComponent(
      url
    )}`}
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
  >
    <Mail /> Send as email
  </a>
);
```

### Copy to clipboard

The last option we want to offer is a button which copies the article url to the clipboard of the client.

```tsx
import { Check, Copy } from "lucide-react";

type Props = {
  url: string;
};

const CopyToClipboardButton = ({ url }: Props) => {
  const [copied, setCopied] = useState(false);

  const copy = () => {
    window.navigator.clipboard.writeText(url);
    setCopied(true);
  };

  return <button onClick={copy}>{copied ? <Check /> : <Copy />} Copy to clipboard</button>;
};
```

The button shows a copy icon and after it is clicked we use the clipboard api to copy the url.
After the url is copied, the button shows a check mark instead of the copy icon.

### Share menu

Now we are able to complete the fallback share menu.

```tsx
<Dialog open={isOpen} onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)}>
  <Dialog.Panel>
    <Dialog.Title>Share article</Dialog.Title>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <PocketLink />
      </li>
      <li>
        <TwitterLink />
      </li>
      <li>
        <FacebookLink />
      </li>
      <li>
        <LinkedInLink />
      </li>
      <li>
        <MailToLink />
      </li>
      <li>
        <CopyToClipboardButton />
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Dialog.Panel>
</Dialog>
```

## Complete example

For a complete example,
which is styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/),
have a look at the source code of my blog ([ShareButton sdorra.dev](https://github.com/sdorra/sdorra.dev/blob/main/components/ShareButton.tsx)).
