Sometimes it is easier to build a component in isolation than in the place where it will be used.
It is much easier to test all variations and edge cases of the component.
There are tools out there which can help us to build our components in isolation.
The most famous is [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/),
but I like to use [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/).
[Ladle](https://ladle.dev/) is much smaller than [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and it is built for speed.
In this post we will set up [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/) and
we will learn how we can use [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) within [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/).

## Setup

First we have to install [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/):

<CH.Code>

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -D @ladle/react
```

```bash yarn
yarn add -D @ladle/react
```

```bash npm
npm install --save-dev @ladle/react
```

</CH.Code>

And for most installations, that's it.
Ladle has a useful default configuration,
you only need to create a configuration if your installation differs from the default.
But for most [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) installations the default does not fit.
[Ladle](https://ladle.dev/) expects [stories](https://ladle.dev/docs/stories) and components in the "src" folder,
but in many Next.js installations they are in a folder called components.
So we have to create a [configuration](https://ladle.dev/docs/config#ladleconfigmjs) at `.ladle/config.mjs`:

```js .ladle/config.mjs
export default {
  stories: "components/**/*.stories.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
};
```

With this configuration ladle is able to find our stories.
A good time to write our first story.

## First Story

We want to create our first Story for the following component.

```tsx components/Avatar.tsx
type Props = {
  src: string;
  alt: string;
  size?: "sm" | "md" | "lg" | "xl";
};

const sizes = {
  sm: 16,
  md: 32,
  lg: 64,
  xl: 128,
};

const Avatar = ({ src, alt, size = "md" }: Props) => (
  <img
    className="rounded-full shadow-md ring-2 ring-zinc-300 dark:ring-zinc-700"
    src={src}
    width={sizes[size]}
    height={sizes[size]}
    alt={alt}
  />
);

export default Avatar;
```

We want to create a story which shows us all sizes of the `Avatar` component next to each other.
To create a new story we have to create a story file next to our component:

```tsx components/Avatar.stories.tsx
import Avatar from "./Avatar";

export const Default = () => <Avatar src="https://robohash.org/sdorra.dev" alt="Robohash of sdorra.dev" />;

export const Sizes = () => (
  <div className="flex gap-4">
    <Avatar src="https://robohash.org/sdorra.dev" alt="Robohash of sdorra.dev" size="sm" />
    <Avatar src="https://robohash.org/sdorra.dev" alt="Robohash of sdorra.dev" size="md" />
    <Avatar src="https://robohash.org/sdorra.dev" alt="Robohash of sdorra.dev" size="lg" />
    <Avatar src="https://robohash.org/sdorra.dev" alt="Robohash of sdorra.dev" size="xl" />
  </div>
);
```

Now it is time to start [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/).

<CH.Code>

```bash pnpm
pnpm ladle dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn ladle dev
```

```bash npm
npm ladle dev
```

</CH.Code>

[Ladle](https://ladle.dev/) should show 2 stories below `Avatar`.
`Default` which shows our component within its default size and
`Sizes` which shows the component in all available sizes next to each other.

<Notification type="info" title="Bonus" prose>
With a little bit of typescript magic, we can avoid the duplicate definitions of the sizes.

<CH.Code>

```tsx components/Avatar.tsx
// we export sizes so that we can reuse it in our story
export const sizes = {
  sm: 16,
  md: 32,
  lg: 64,
  xl: 128,
};

// we can infer the union type of Size from the sizes object
export type Size = keyof typeof sizes;

type Props = {
  src: string;
  alt: string;
  // we can use our inferred type
  size?: Size;
};

const Avatar = ({ src, alt, size = "md" }: Props) => (
  <img
    className="rounded-full shadow-md ring-2 ring-zinc-300 dark:ring-zinc-700"
    src={src}
    width={sizes[size]}
    height={sizes[size]}
    alt={alt}
  />
);

export default Avatar;
```

```tsx components/Avatar.stories.tsx
import Avatar, { sizes } from "./Avatar";

export const Default = () => (
  <Avatar src="https://robohash.org/sdorra.dev" alt="Robohash of sdorra.dev" />
);

// We can now create an array of sizes from the exported object.
// Unfortunately we have to cast the array using `as`,
// because `Object.keys` only returns `string[]`.
// https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/12870
const sizeKeys = Object.keys(sizes) as Size[];

export const Sizes = () => (
  <div className="flex gap-4">
    {/* We can loop over the array of sizes */}
    {sizeKeys.map(size) => (
      <Avatar key={size} src="https://robohash.org/sdorra.dev" alt="Robohash of sdorra.dev" size={size} />
    )}
  </div>
);
```

</CH.Code>

### next/image

After we got [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/) running and wrote our first story,
we want to develop our component further.
We want to use [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) instead of `img` to get all the advantages of [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image).
So we just replace the `img` tag with the `Image` tag from [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image).

```tsx components/Avatar.tsx
import Image from "next/image";

// Types and props remain unchanged

const Avatar = ({ src, alt, size = "md" }: Props) => (
  <Image
    className="rounded-full shadow-md ring-2 ring-zinc-300 dark:ring-zinc-700"
    src={src}
    width={sizes[size]}
    height={sizes[size]}
    alt={alt}
  />
);
```

But now we get an error in ladle.

<Notification type="error">
  Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined
</Notification>

After a short research session I found the following issue on GitHub.

https://github.com/tajo/ladle/issues/100

One of the comments provided the following solution.
We have to create a file called `vite.config.ts` in the root of our project.

```ts vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  define: {
    "process.env": process.env,
  },
});
```

That fixes the `process is not defined` error,
but we immediately get the next error.

<Notification type="error">
  Uncaught Error: Invalid src prop (https://robohash.org/sdorra.dev) on `next/image`,
  hostname "robohash.org" is not configured under images in your `next.config.js`
  See more info: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/next-image-unconfigured-host
</Notification>

All right, but we don't want to add the entry to `next.config.js`` at all,
since this is just test data and besides,
we still get the same error when we make the entry.

After another look at [issue #100](https://github.com/tajo/ladle/issues/100),
we can tell [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) that it should skip the optimization if the component is rendered in ladle.
That is fine, because the bandwidth does not play a big role during the development.
With the following code placed inside `.ladle/components.tsx` ...

```tsx .ladle/components.tsx
import * as NextImage from "next/image";

const OriginalNextImage = NextImage.default;

Object.defineProperty(NextImage, "default", {
  configurable: true,
  value: (props) => (
    <OriginalNextImage
      {...props}
      unoptimized
    />
  ),
});
```

... we can add the `unoptimized` to each usage of `next/image`.
Great, that fixed our problem.
But unfortunately only in the development mode of [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/).
If we run the production build (`ladle build` and `ladle preview`), we get the next error.

<Notification type="error">
  Uncaught TypeError: Cannot redefine property: default
</Notification>

Our solution does not work with the production build, we have to find another solution.

#### The solution

Fortunately, I thought of another way to get the `unoptimized` prop to all image instances.
We can create an alias for the `next/image` import and resolve `next/image` to a custom component.
This can be done in the `vite.config.ts`:

```ts vite.config.ts focus=5:9
import path from "path";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "next/image": path.resolve(__dirname, "./UnoptimizedImage.tsx"),
    },
  },
  define: {
    "process.env": process.env,
  },
});
```

Now we can write our own image component to `UnoptimizedImage.tsx`.
But what if we want to use the original `next/image` component in our component?
In order to achieve this we can define another alias in the `vite.config.ts`:

```ts vite.config.ts focus=7
import path from "path";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "next/original-image": require.resolve('next/image'),
      "next/image": path.resolve(__dirname, "./UnoptimizedImage.tsx"),
    },
  },
  define: {
    "process.env": process.env,
  },
});
```

Now we should have everything together to make our `UnoptimizedImage`.

```tsx .ladle/UnoptimizedImage.tsx
import React from "react";
// @ts-ignore have a look in vite.config.ts
import OriginalImage from "next/original-image";

const UnoptimizedImage = (props: any) => {
  return <OriginalImage {...props} unoptimized />;
};

export default UnoptimizedImage;
```

After that we only have to remove the workaround from `.ladle/components.tsx` or
we can remove the complete file if it has no other content.
After a quick look into [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/) (production and development mode),
we can see that we have finally solved the problem.
