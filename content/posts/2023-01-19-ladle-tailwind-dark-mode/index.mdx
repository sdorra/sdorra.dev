In [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/) there is a handy button which is able to switch between light and dark mode.
However, this only switches the ui of [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/).
Wouldn't it be great if it could also switch the mode of our [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) components, with the same button?
It turns out that we can.
We only have to create a [GlobalProvider](https://ladle.dev/docs/providers).

## The GlobalProvider

A global provider can be used to enhance stories or provide additional context to them.
In this example we use the [class strategy](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode#toggling-dark-mode-manually) to toggle the dark mode in [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
So we want to add the `dark` class to the `html` element when dark mode is active in [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/) and
we want to make sure it is not present when light mode is active.

To create the global provider we create a file at `.ladle/components.tsx`.
Then we have to export a component called `Provider` of type `GlobalProvider`.
The `Provider` receives the following props:

* **children**: The current story
* **globalState**: The global state of [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/), which contains the active theme
* **storyMeta**: The metadata of the story, such as the name

To achieve our goal we have to create a component which uses an [Effect Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)
which toggles the `dark` class whenever the theme in [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/) changes.

```tsx .ladle/components.tsx
import type { GlobalProvider } from "@ladle/react";
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import "tailwindcss/tailwind.css";

export const Provider: GlobalProvider = ({ children, globalState }) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    if (globalState.theme === "dark") {
      document.documentElement.classList.add("dark");
    } else {
      document.documentElement.classList.remove("dark");
    }
  }, [globalState.theme]);
  return <div className="p-4">{children}</div>;
};
```

That's all, have fun developing components in light and dark mode.
