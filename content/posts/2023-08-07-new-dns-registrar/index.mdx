Recently, I was listening to episode [#632](https://syntax.fm/show/632/where-to-register-a-domain) of the [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/) podcast.
In this episode, [Scott](https://twitter.com/stolinski) and [Wes](https://twitter.com/wesbos) were talking about domain registrars.
That prompted me to take a closer look at my own domains.
Over the years, I've registered a few domains with three different providers ([STRATO](https://www.strato.de/), [united-domains](https://www.united-domains.de/), and [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/)).
I wasn't happy with any of those providers, so I decided to look for a new one.

## Looking for a new provider

I don't require much from a DNS registrar.
I need support for `.org`, `.de`, and `.dev` top-level domains (TLDs).
Additionally, I require an API for automation, and it must be possible to create Let's Encrypt wildcard certificates.
[Scott](https://twitter.com/stolinski) and [Wes](https://twitter.com/wesbos) mentioned in the episode that they both use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).
However, at the time I was searching for a new provider, [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) did not support `.dev` TLDs.

<Notification type="info">
[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) now offers `.dev`.
Please have a look at [Cloudflare TLD Policies](https://www.cloudflare.com/tld-policies/).

But they mentioned [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) as a surprisingly cheap alternative. I've never heard of [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/), so I decided to take a closer look at it.

## Porkbun

The first impression wasn't really good after I visited their website.
The site itself looks like a [Bootstrap 2](https://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) demo application, and the name and logo do not look professional at all.
But holy shit, the prices are really cheap.

| Domain  | STRATO | united-domains | GoDaddy | Porkbun |
| ------- | ------ | -------------- | ------- | ------- |
| **de**  | $13.17 | $20.85         | $11.89  | $4.07   |
| **org** | $19.76 | $27.44         | $27.57  | $10.72  |
| **dev** | $26.34 | $31.83         | $24.00  | $10.79  |

<p className="text-xs">Prices from August 2023. STRATO and united-domains prices are converted from Euro (â‚¬).</p>

And they offer a simple-looking [API](https://porkbun.com/api/json/v3/documentation).
So I decided to go down the road and move one of my domains over to [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/).

<Notification type="info" title="Good to know">
  You don't need to wait for the domain subscription to expire before changing the domain registrar. When you transfer
  the domain to a new registrar, you will need to pay for one year of registration at the new registrar. However, this
  year will be added to the remaining duration of your current subscription. The domain transfer process usually takes a
  few hours or days, depending on the registrars.
</Notification>

The transfer from [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) to [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) went smoothly.
So i want to try the [API](https://porkbun.com/api/json/v3/documentation).

### API

First, we need to enable the API for our domain, and then we have to create a key pair for authentication.
The [Getting started with the Porkbun API](https://kb.porkbun.com/article/190-getting-started-with-the-porkbun-api) entry of the knowledge base of [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) explains this process very well.
Let's review the [documentation](https://porkbun.com/api/json/v3/documentation) and begin with a shell script.

#### Shell script

```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{
    "apikey" : "pk1_...",
    "secretapikey" : "sk1_...",
    "name" : "example",
    "type" : "A",
    "content" : "1.2.3.4",
    "ttl" : "600"
  }' \
  https://porkbun.com/api/json/v3/dns/create/sdorra.dev
```

That was not to complicated lets try TypeScript.

#### TypeScript

```ts
const response = await fetch("https://porkbun.com/api/json/v3/dns/create/sdorra.dev", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    apikey: "pk1_...",
    secretapikey: "sk1_...",
    name: "example",
    type: "A",
    content: "1.2.3.4",
    ttl: "600",
  }),
});

if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error("Failed to create dns record");
}
```

This was also easy. Next, ansible.

#### Ansible

```yaml
- name: Set record name and ip
  set_fact:
    domain: "sdorra.dev"
    porkbun_apikey: "pk1_..."
    porkbun_secretapikey: "sk1_..."
    record_name: "example"
    record_ip: "1.2.3.4"

- name: Get status of record from porkbun
  uri:
    url: "https://porkbun.com/api/json/v3/dns/retrieveByNameType/{{domain}}/A/{{ record_name }}"
    method: POST
    body_format: json
    body:
      apikey: "{{ porkbun_apikey }}"
      secretapikey: "{{ porkbun_secretapikey }}"
  register: result

- name: Create porkbun record
  uri:
    url: "https://porkbun.com/api/json/v3/dns/create/{{domain}}"
    method: POST
    body_format: json
    body:
      apikey: "{{ porkbun_apikey }}"
      secretapikey: "{{ porkbun_secretapikey }}"
      name: "{{ record_name }}"
      type: "A"
      content: "{{ record_ip }}"
      ttl: "600"
  when: result.json.records is not defined or result.json.records | length == 0

- name: Update porkbun record
  uri:
    url: https://porkbun.com/api/json/v3/dns/editByNameType/{{domain}}/A/{{ record_name }}
    method: POST
    body_format: json
    body:
      apikey: "{{ porkbun_apikey }}"
      secretapikey: "{{ porkbun_secretapikey }}"
      name: "{{ record_name }}"
      type: "A"
      content: "{{ record_ip }}"
      ttl: "600"
  when: result.json.records is defined and result.json.records | length > 0 and result.json.records[0].content != record_ip
```

This was more complicated, but it is not the fault of the API; it lies in the nature of Ansible.
Ansible is a declarative tool, while the API is imperative.
Therefore, we need to check if the record exists and if the IP is correct.
If the record does not exist, we need to create it, and if the IP is wrong, we need to update it.

So far, so good. But what about Let's Encrypt wildcard certificates?

#### Let's Encrypt

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v certificates:/var/lib/lego/certificates \
  -v lego_accounts:/var/lib/lego/accounts \
  -e PORKBUN_API_KEY="pk1_..." \
  -e PORKBUN_SECRET_API_KEY="sk1_..." \
  goacme/lego:v4.12.3 \
  --accept-tos \
  --email="email.for.letsencrypt.account@example.com" \
  --dns="porkbun" \
  --domains="*.sdorra.dev" \
  --domains="sdorra.dev" \
  --path="/var/lib/lego" \
  run
```

We use the [LEGO](https://go-acme.github.io/lego/) tool, running in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container, to create the certificates.
That works like a charm.

### Conclusion

Now, I have tested everything I need for my domains.
Even if [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) does not look professional,
the service offers everything I need, and the prices are really cheap.
There are no more excuses not to move all my domains to Porkbun.
