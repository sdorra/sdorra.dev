In the [last article](/posts/2023-08-07-new-dns-registrar), I explained why I moved all my domains to [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/).
One of the reasons was the [API](http://localhost:3000/posts/2023-08-07-new-dns-registrar#api) and its compatibility with [Ansible](/posts/2023-08-07-new-dns-registrar#ansible).
I frequently use [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to set up and manage my home server as well as a few remote ones.
This often involves creating and managing DNS records. However, the method I demonstrated in the [New DNS Registrar](/posts/2023-08-07-new-dns-registrar#ansible) article is quite verbose, requiring at least three tasks with numerous parameters.
I believe we can improve upon it.

## Ansible modules

Let's write an [Ansible module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_modules_general.html) to summarize the logic of the three tasks.

In order to create a module we need a single file and a some python knowledge.
First we create a `library` folder and inside it we create a file with the name of our module.
In the case of our porkbun module, we choose `porkbun_record.py`.
We start our module with a class which handles the porkbun api.

### PorkbunAPI class

```python library/porkbun_record.py
class PorkbunAPI:
  def __init__(self, api_key, secret_api_key):
    # TODO implement

  def get_records(self, domain):
    # TODO implement

  def get_record(self, domain, record_type, name):
    # TODO implement

  def create_record(self, domain, record_type, name, content, ttl):
    # TODO implement

  def update_record(self, domain, record_type, name, content, ttl):
    # TODO implement

  def delete_record(self, domain, record_id):
    # TODO implement
```

We need methods to get, create, update, and delete records.
For each of those methods, we need the `api_key` and the `secret_api_key`.
Therefore, we pass the keys in the constructor (the `__init__` method).
To use the keys, we have to store them for later use.
In addition to the keys, we define the `API_URL` and specify the default headers for our method calls.
Now, our constructor should look like the following:

```python
class PorkbunAPI:
  API_URL = "https://porkbun.com/api/json/v3/dns"

  def __init__(self, api_key, secret_api_key):
    self.headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    }

    self.base_params = {
        'apikey': api_key,
        'secretapikey': secret_api_key
    }
```

We need methods to get, create, update, and delete records. For each of those methods, we need the `api_key` and the `secret_api_key`.
Therefore, we pass the keys in the constructor (the `__init__` method).
To use the keys, we have to store them for later use. In addition to the keys, we define the `API_URL` and specify the default headers for our method calls.
Now, our constructor should look like the following:

```python
import json
from ansible.module_utils.urls import open_url
```

After that, we can begin the implementation of our methods.

```python
def get_records(self, domain):
  response = open_url(f'{self.API_URL}/retrieve/{domain}',
                      method="POST", headers=self.headers, data=json.dumps(self.base_params))
  result = json.loads(response.read())
  return result['records']
```

As we can see, we use the `open_url` method to make a `POST` request to the Porkbun API.
We use `f` to format the URL with our `API_URL` and the domain we want to retrieve the records for.
We also pass the `headers` and the `data` to the `open_url` method, which we defined in the constructor.
The `open_url` method returns a file-like object that we can read and parse with the `json` module.
The DNS records are stored in the `records` key of the JSON response.

```python
def get_record(self, domain, record_type, name):
  records = self.get_records(domain)
  for record in records:
      if record['type'] == record_type and record['name'] == name + "." + domain:
          return record
  return None
```

For the `get_record` method, we use the `get_records` method we just implemented.
We iterate over the records and return the first record that matches the `record_type` and `name` parameters.

```python
def create_record(self, domain, record_type, name, content, ttl):
  data = {
    **self.base_params,
    'type': record_type,
    'name': name,
    'content': content,
    'ttl': ttl
  }
  response = open_url(f'{self.API_URL}/create/{domain}',
                      method='POST', headers=self.headers, data=json.dumps(data))
  return json.loads(response.read())
```

For the `create_record` method, we create a dictionary with the `base_params` and the parameters we want to pass to the API.
We then make another `POST` request to the API, as we did in the `get_records` method.

The `update_record` method is very similar to the `create_record` method and does not require further explanation.

```python
def update_record(self, domain, record_type, name, content, ttl):
  data = {
    **self.base_params,
    'content': content,
    'ttl': ttl
  }
  response = open_url(f'{self.API_URL}/editByNameType/{domain}/{record_type}/{name}',
                      method='POST', headers=self.headers, data=json.dumps(data))
  return json.loads(response.read())
```

For the `delete_record` method, we require the `record_id`, which is returned by the `get_records` method.

```python
def delete_record(self, domain, record_id):
  response = open_url(f'{self.API_URL}/delete/{domain}/{record_id}',
                      method='POST', headers=self.headers, data=json.dumps(self.base_params))
  return json.loads(response.read())
```

Now that we have implemented the `PorkbunAPI` class, we can move on to the module itself.

### The main method

An Ansible module requires a `main` method, which is the entry point of the module.
It also requires some metadata, which we define in the `ANSIBLE_METADATA` variable.

```python
ANSIBLE_METADATA = {
    'metadata_version': '1.1',
    'status': ['preview'],
    'supported_by': 'community'
}
```

In the `main` method, we define the parameters that we want to pass to the module.
In our case this are the parameters which are required for our `PorkbunAPI` class.
We define the parameters with the `argument_spec` variable, which is a parameter of the `AnsibleModule` class.
But before we can use the `AnsibleModule` class, we need to import it at the top of our file.

```python
from ansible.module_utils.basic import AnsibleModule
```

Now we can start to implement the `main` method.

```python
def main():
  module = AnsibleModule(
    argument_spec=dict(
      state=dict(default='present', choices=['present', 'absent']),
      domain=dict(required=True, type='str'),
      record_type=dict(required=True, type='str', choices=[
                      'A', 'MX', 'CNAME', 'ALIAS', 'TXT', 'NS', 'AAAA', 'SRV', 'TLSA', 'CAA']),
      name=dict(required=True, type='str'),
      content=dict(required=True, type='str'),
      ttl=dict(required=False, type='int', default=600),
      api_key=dict(required=True, type='str', no_log=True),
      secret_api_key=dict(required=True, type='str', no_log=True),
    ),
  )
```

The `state` parameter is used to determine whether we want to create or delete a record.
After we can use the `PorkbunAPI` class to create an instance of the API.

```python
api_key = module.params['api_key']
secret_api_key = module.params['secret_api_key']

porkbun = PorkbunAPI(api_key, secret_api_key)
```

Now we can fetch the state of the record, we want to manage.

```python
domain = module.params['domain']
record_type = module.params['record_type']
name = module.params['name']

record = porkbun.get_record(domain, record_type, name)
```

Now it is time to implement the logic for the `present` state.

```python
state = module.params['state']

if state == 'present':
  if record is None:
    porkbun.create_record(domain, record_type, name, content, ttl)
    module.exit_json(changed=True, msg="DNS record created")
```

If the record does not exist, we create it.
The `module.exit_json` method is used to return the result of the module.
The `changed` key indicates whether the module changed the state of the system.
The `msg` key contains a message that is displayed to the user.
If the record exists, we check if the content is the same as the one we want to set.
If it is not, we update the record.

```python
elif record['content'] != content or int(record['ttl']) != ttl:
  porkbun.update_record(domain, record_type, name, content, ttl)
  module.exit_json(changed=True, msg="DNS record updated")
```

If the content is the same, we do not need to do anything and we can exit the module.

```python
else:
  module.exit_json(changed=False, msg="DNS record already exists")
```

Now we can implement the logic for the `absent` state.

```python
elif state == 'absent':
  if record is not None:
    porkbun.delete_record(domain, record['id'])
    module.exit_json(changed=True, msg="DNS record deleted")
```

If the record exists, we delete it.
If the record does not exist, we do not need to do anything and we can exit the module.

```python
else:
  module.exit_json(changed=False, msg="DNS record does not exist")
```

Finally, we need to call the `main` method.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

Now we can test our module.

## Testing the module

To test our module, we create a playbook with the following content.

```yaml playbook.yml
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: no

  tasks:
    - name: Create DNS record
      porkbun_record:
        state: present
        domain: sdorra.dev
        record_type: A
        name: sample
        content: 192.168.0.42
        ttl: 3600
        api_key: pk1_...
        secret_api_key: sk1_...
```

Ok, we are ready to test our module.

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

If everything works as expected, we should see that the module created the DNS record.
That is it, we have created an Ansible module to manage DNS records with the Porkbun API.

After we have tested our module, we can publish it to [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/).
But before we can publish it, we should add some documentation to our module.

## Documentation

We start with the `DOCUMENTATION` variable.
The `DOCUMENTATION` variable is a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) string which contains the documentation for our module.

```python
DOCUMENTATION = r'''
---
module: porkbun_record
short_description: Manage DNS records on Porkbun
description:
  - This module allows you to create, update, and delete DNS records on Porkbun using the Porkbun API.
options:
  state:
    description:
      - Whether the record should exist or not.
    choices: [ 'present', 'absent' ]
    default: 'present'
  domain:
    description:
      - The domain to add the DNS record to.
    required: true
    type: str
  record_type:
    description:
      - The type of DNS record to manage.
    choices: [ 'A', 'MX', 'CNAME', 'ALIAS', 'TXT', 'NS', 'AAAA', 'SRV', 'TLSA', 'CAA' ]
    required: true
    type: str
  name:
    description:
      - The name of the DNS record.
    required: true
    type: str
  content:
    description:
      - The content of the DNS record.
    required: true
    type: str
  ttl:
    description:
      - The time-to-live of the DNS record.
    default: 600
    type: int
  api_key:
    description:
      - The API key for the Porkbun API.
    required: true
    type: str
    no_log: true
  secret_api_key:
    description:
      - The secret API key for the Porkbun API.
    required: true
    type: str
    no_log: true
'''
```

Next we define the `EXAMPLES` variable.

```python
EXAMPLES = r'''
# Create an A record
- porkbun_dns:
    state: present
    domain: example.com
    record_type: A
    name: www
    content: 192.0.2.1
    ttl: 3600
    api_key: your_api_key
    secret_api_key: your_secret_api_key

# Delete a TXT record
- porkbun_dns:
    state: absent
    domain: example.com
    record_type: TXT
    name: www
    content: "v=spf1 -all"
    api_key: your_api_key
    secret_api_key: your_secret_api_key

# Update an existing MX record
- porkbun_dns:
    state: present
    domain: example.com
    record_type: MX
    name: mail
    content: "10 mail.example.com."
    ttl: 7200
    api_key: your_api_key
    secret_api_key: your_secret_api_key
'''
```

We also define the `RETURN` variable.

```python
RETURNS = r'''
changed:
  description: Whether or not the DNS record was changed
  returned: always
  type: bool
msg:
  description: A message describing what happened
  returned: always
  type: str
'''
```

We also need a `README.md` file, which should contain a short documentation of our module.

## Publishing

Now we can publish our module to [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/).
To publish our module, we have to create a [collection](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections_guide/index.html).
Collections use a different folder structure than our module does.
Therefore, we have to move our module to a folder called `plugins/modules` folder.
We also have to create a `galaxy.yml` file in the root of our collection.
The `galaxy.yml` file contains metadata about our collection.

```yaml galaxy.yml
# The namespace of the collection.
namespace: sdorra
# The name of the collection.
name: porkbun
# The version of the collection.
version: 1.0.0
# The path to the Markdown (.md) readme file
readme: README.md
# A list of the collection's content authors.
authors:
- Sebastian Sdorra <s.sdorra@gmail.com>
# Optional short description of the collection
description: Ansible collection for managing dns records on porkbun.com
# Either a single license or a list of licenses for content inside of the collection
license:
- GPL-2.0-or-later
# A list of tags you want to associate with the collection for indexing/searching.
tags: ['dns', 'porkbun', 'domain', 'module']
# Collections that this collection requires to be installed for it to be usable.
dependencies: {}
# The URL of the originating SCM repository
repository: https://github.com/sdorra/ansible-collection-porkbun
# The URL to the collection issue tracker
issues: hhttps://github.com/sdorra/ansible-collection-porkbun/issues
# A list of file glob-like patterns used to filter any files or directories that should not be included in the build
build_ignore: []
```

Now we can build our collection.

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection build
```

The build command creates a tarball with the namespace, name and version of the collection (`sdorra-porkbun-1.0.0.tar.gz`).
This tarball can be uploaded to [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/).
To upload the tarball, we have to create an account on [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/) and create an [API key](https://galaxy.ansible.com/me/preferences).
After we have our API key, we can upload the tarball.

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection publish sdorra-porkbun-1.0.0.tar.gz --api-key <your-api-key>
```

### Usage with Ansible Galaxy

After we have published our collection, we can install it with the `ansible-galaxy` command.

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install sdorra.porkbun
```

And use it in our playbooks:

```yaml playbook.yml
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: no

  tasks:
  - name: Create DNS record
    sdorra.porkbun.porkbun_record:
      state: present
      domain: example.com
      record_type: A
      name: www
      content: 192.168.0.42
      ttl: 3600
      api_key: your_api_key
      secret_api_key: your_secret_api_key
```

## Conclusion
