import { SimpleDivSpinner, SimpleSvgSpinner } from "@components/TailwindCircleSpinners";

We can create nice loading spinners without using external libraries and even without JavaScript. Here are two simple examples of how to create loading spinners with Tailwind CSS.

## Simple div spinner

We can create a simple loading spinner with just a `<div>` and some Tailwind CSS classes.

<SimpleDivSpinner />

Looks pretty good, right? Let's take a look at the code.

```html
<div class="h-6 w-6 animate-spin rounded-full border-b-2 border-current" />
```

The classes explained:

* `h-6` and `w-6` set the height and width of the div.
* `border-b-2` creates a 2px border at the bottom of the div.
* `border-current` sets the border color to the current text color.
* `rounded-full` turns the bottom border into a half circle.
* `animate-spin` animates the spinner.

## Simple SVG spinner

Now, let's create a more complex spinner with SVG.

<SimpleSvgSpinner />

We will start with the SVG element.

```html
<svg class="h-6 w-6 animate-spin" viewBox="0 0 100 100"></svg>
```

The SVG element has a viewBox of 100x100.
This means that the SVG element will be 100x100 pixels.
We will also use `h-6` and `w-6` classes to set the height and width of the SVG element, and the `animate-spin` class to animate the spinner.

Now, we will add a circle to the SVG element.

```html
<circle
  fill="none"
  stroke-width="10"
  class="stroke-current opacity-40"
  cx="50"
  cy="50"
  r="40"
/>
```

Let's take a closer look at the used attributes:

* `fill="none"` removes the fill color of the circle.
* `stroke-width="10"` sets the width of the circle's stroke to 10px.
* `class="stroke-current opacity-40"` sets the stroke color to the current text color and the opacity to 40%.
* `cx="50" cy="50" r="40"` sets the center of the circle to 50x50 and the radius to 40px.

Now, we will add a second circle to the SVG element.

```html
<circle
  fill="none"
  stroke-width="10"
  class="stroke-current"
  stroke-dasharray="250"
  stroke-dashoffset="210"
  cx="50"
  cy="50"
  r="40"
/>
```

The second circle is almost the same as the first one, but it has two additional attributes:

* `stroke-dasharray="250"` sets the length of the stroke to 250px.
* `stroke-dashoffset="210"` sets the offset of the stroke to 210px.

This means that we will only see a part of the second circle.
 If you want to know more about the `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` attributes, have a look at [this article](https://css-tricks.com/svg-line-animation-works/).

Here is the combined code:

```html
<svg class="h-6 w-6 animate-spin" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <circle
    fill="none"
    stroke-width="10"
    class="stroke-current opacity-40"
    cx="50"
    cy="50"
    r="40"
  />
  <circle
    fill="none"
    stroke-width="10"
    class="stroke-current"
    stroke-dasharray="250"
    stroke-dashoffset="210"
    cx="50"
    cy="50"
    r="40"
  />
</svg>
```
