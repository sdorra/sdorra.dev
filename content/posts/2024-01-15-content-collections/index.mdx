## Contentlayer

I am a big fan of [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/).
I have used it for numerous projects and I absolutely love it, especially the developer experience (DX).
The ability to define a schema for content and obtain a typed API with a simple import is truly amazing.
However, there are a few aspects of [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/) that I do not like as much.

### The schema

The schema definition lacks flexibility.
I want the ability to replace a property, such as defining a URL within the frontmatter and having the build process fetch content from that URL to replace the property in the schema.
Additionally, I would like to remove default properties (Please refer to [Contentlayer, MDX and the Vercel Edge Function Size Limit](/posts/2022-11-24-contentlayer-mdx-edge) for more information).
There is also no option to transform the final schema.
The schema validation is not as powerful as I would like it to be.
I want to be able to define not only a string, but also an email or a URL.

### The orientation of the project

The project has started implementing sources for various external systems such as [Notion](https://notion.so), [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), or [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/).
However, I am only interested in local files and there is so much more we could do before we start to implement sources for external systems.

### Current state of development

As of writing this post, the last [release](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/releases/tag/v0.3.4) was made on 2023-06-29, and the last [commit](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/commit/2f491c540e1d3667577f57fa368b150bff427aaf) was made on 2023-09-23.
The maintainer of the project, [schickling](https://github.com/schickling), was sponsored by [Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/) for his work on [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/).
However, [Stackbit was recently acquired by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/netlify-acquires-stackbit-to-bring-no-code-creation-to-its-platform/), and it is unclear if [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) will continue to sponsor [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/).

## Content Collections

So with that in mind, I decided to start an alternative [Content Collections](https://content-collections.dev).
The project is heavily inspired by [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/), but I've tried to address the issues I have with it.
The project is still in an early stage of development, but I am quite happy with the things I have implemented so far.
Lets have a look at the configuration.

### Configuration

[Content Collections](https://content-collections.dev) uses a TypeScript file for its configuration.
The configuration is done in a file called `content-collections.ts`, which should be placed in the root of your project.

```ts
import { defineCollection, defineConfig } from "@content-collections/core";

const posts = defineCollection({
  name: "posts",
  directory: "src/posts",
  include: "**/*.md",
  schema: (z) => ({
    title: z.string(),
    summary: z.string(),
  }),
});

export default defineConfig({
  collections: [posts],
});
```

The configuration consists of two parts.
The first part is the definition of collections, which can be done with the `defineCollection` function.
The second part is the definition of the configuration itself, which can be done with the `defineConfig` function.

Lets have a closer look at the collection definition.
We have a name, a directory and a include pattern.
I think those properties are self explanatory.
At the moment, [Content Collections](https://content-collections.dev) only supports files with a frontmatter section and string content (such as markdown or mdx files),
but I plan to add support for other formats in the future.

More interesting is the schema definition.

### Schema

The schema definition is powered by [zod](https://zod.dev) and it can be used to do some pretty cool things.
E.g.: we can do complex validations:

```ts
schema: (z) => ({
  title: z.string().min(1).max(160),
  author: z.object({
    name: z.string().min(1),
    mail: z.string().email().optional(),
  }),
  tags: z.array(z.string().min(1).max(20)),
}),
```

And the really cool thing is that [Content Collections](https://content-collections.dev) will generate TypeScript types for the collection, which infers its shape from the schema definition.

But I took it further with the `transform` function.

### Transformation

The `transform` function can be used not only to transform the final schema, but also to add data from other sources.
Let's have a look at some examples.

Let's say we want to generate a slug to our posts.

```ts
schema: (z) => ({
  title: z.string().min(1).max(160),
}),
transform: (context, data) => {
  const slug = data.title.toLowerCase().replace(/\s/g, "-");
  return { ...data, slug };
},
```

Or, we have a summarization API and we want to add a summary to our posts.

```ts
schema: (z) => ({
  title: z.string().min(1).max(160),
}),
transform: async (context, data) => {
  const { title, content } = data;
  const summary = await fetch(
    `https://api.summarization.com/summarize?title=${title}&content=${content}`
  ).then((res) => res.text());
  return { ...data, summary };
},
```

The last example is a bit more complex.
Let's say we have a collection of authors and we want to add the authors to our posts.
Each post has an `author` property which contains the name of the author.
We can use the `transform` function to replace the name with the actual author object.

```ts
import { defineCollection, defineConfig } from "@content-collections/core";

const authors = defineCollection({
  name: "authors",
  schema: (z) => ({
    name: z.string(),
    displayName: z.string(),
    email: z.string().email(),
  }),
  directory: "authors",
  include: "*.md",
});

const posts = defineCollection({
  name: "posts",
  typeName: "Post",
  schema: (z) => ({
    title: z.string().min(5),
    author: z.string(),
  }),
  directory: "posts",
  include: "**/*.md(x)?",
  transform: async (context, post) => {
    const author = context.documents(authors).find((author) => author.name === post.author);

    if (!author) {
      throw new Error(`Author not found: ${post.author}`);
    }

    return {
      ...post,
      author,
    };
  },
});

export default defineConfig({
  collections: [authors, posts],
});
```

Even for complex transformations, [Content Collections](https://content-collections.dev) will infer the correct type for the collection.

### Content

The main difference to [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/) is that [Content Collections](https://content-collections.dev) does not compile or parse the content.
The content is just a string.
It can be validated by adding a `content` property to the schema.
But if we want to parse or compile it, we have to use the `transform` function.
Here is an example with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/):

```ts
import { defineCollection, defineConfig } from "@content-collections/core";
import { compile } from "@mdx-js/mdx";

const docs = defineCollection({
  name: "docs",
  directory: "docs",
  include: "**/*.mdx",
  schema: (z) => ({
    title: z.string(),
  }),
  transform: async (context, { content, ...data }) => {
    const body = String(
      await compile(content, {
        outputFormat: "function-body",
      }),
    );
    return {
      ...data,
      body,
    };
  },
});

export default defineConfig({
  collections: [docs],
});
```

Why does [Content Collections](https://content-collections.dev) not parse or compile the content?
Because there are so many different formats and libraries out there and I don't want to limit the user to a specific format or library.

### The CLI

Add the moment, there is only a CLI to work with [Content Collections](https://content-collections.dev).
In the future, I plan to add support for major frontend frameworks, such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Remix](https://remix.run/), or [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).
The CLI has only two commands, `build` and `watch`.
I think they are pretty self-explanatory.

```bash
# build the collections
content-collections build
# watch files for changes
content-collections watch
```

### Usage

The usage of [Content Collections](https://content-collections.dev) is very similar to [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/).
Just import the collection and use it.

```tsx
import { allPosts } from "content-collections";
import Markdown from "react-markdown";

export function Posts() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {allPosts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post._meta.path}>
          <a href={`/posts/${post._meta.path}`}>
            <h3>{post.title}</h3>
            <p>{post.summary}</p>
          </a>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export function Post({ slug }: { slug: string }) {
  const post = allPosts.find((post) => post._meta.path === slug);
  if (!post) {
    return <div>Post not found</div>;
  }
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <Markdown>{post.content}</Markdown>
    </article>
  );
}
```

[Content Collections](https://content-collections.dev) will generate a `_meta` property for each document, which contains the path to the document and the collection it belongs to.

With the `_meta` property, we can easily create links to the document and we can also use it to filter the documents.

## Conclusion

I am quite happy with the current state of [Content Collections](https://content-collections.dev).
I think it is a good alternative to [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/).
However, it is still in an early stage of development and there are still a lot of things to do.
If you are interested in the project, please have a look at the [website](https://content-collections.dev) or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sdorra/content-collections) and let me know what you think.
