Sometimes, we need to test code that interacts with the file system.
To avoid conflicts between tests, we should use a temporary directory for each test.
We can use the following function to create the temporary directory.

<CH.Section>

```typescript
import fs from "node:fs/promises";
import os from "node:os";
import path from "node:path";

async function createTempDir() {
  const ostmpdir = os.tmpdir();
  const tmpdir = path.join(ostmpdir, "unit-test-");
  return await fs.mkdtemp(tmpdir);
}
```

- [`os.tmpdir()`](focus://6) returns the system's temporary directory.
- [`path.join()`](focus://7) joins the temporary directory with a prefix.
- [`fs.mkdtemp()`](focus://8) adds a unique suffix to the path and creates the directory.

</CH.Section>

Now, we could use this function in our tests, for example, with the `beforeEach` hook.

```typescript
let tmpdir: string = "";

beforeEach(async () => {
  tmpdir = await createTempDir();
});
```

But if we do not want to fill up the disk with temporary directories,
we should remove the directory after the test.
We can use the `afterEach` hook for this.

```typescript
afterEach(async () => {
  await fs.rm(tmpdir, { recursive: true });
});
```

Now, we can use the `tmpdir` in our tests to create files and directories.
However, if we have many tests, we need to repeat the `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks in each test file.
We can improve this by extending the test context with the temporary directory.

## Vitest context

We can extend the `vitest` context by passing an object to the `test.extend` function.
The object contains a function for each property we want to add to the context.
In our case, we want to add a `tmpdir` property to the context.
The code looks like this:

```typescript tmpdir.ts
import { test } from "vitest";
import os from "node:os";
import fs from "node:fs/promises";
import path from "node:path";

interface TmpDirFixture {
  tmpdir: string;
}

async function createTempDir() {
  const ostmpdir = os.tmpdir();
  const tmpdir = path.join(ostmpdir, "unit-test-");
  return await fs.mkdtemp(tmpdir);
}

export const tmpdirTest = test.extend<TmpDirFixture>({
  tmpdir: async ({}, use) => {
    const directory = await createTempDir();

    await use(directory);

    await fs.rm(directory, { recursive: true });
  },
});
```

The `tmpdir` function receives the current context and a `use` function.
The `use` function is utilized to provide the temporary directory to the test.
The `tmpdir` function generates the temporary directory, passes it to the test, and deletes it after the test.

Now we can employ the `tmpdir` in our tests as follows:

```typescript
import { tmpdirTest } from "./tmpdir";

tmpdirTest("create file", async ({ tmpdir }) => {
  const file = path.join(tmpdir, "file.txt");
  await fs.writeFile(file, "Hello, World!");
  const content = await fs.readFile(file, "utf-8");
  expect(content).toBe("Hello, World!");
});
```

That's it!
Now we have a temporary directory for each test,
and we do not have to repeat the `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks in each test file.
