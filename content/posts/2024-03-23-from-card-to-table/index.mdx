Recently at work, a designer showed me a design for a new service we are building.
The design consisted of a card layout on mobile devices and a table layout on larger devices.
I immediately thought that the implementation would be tricky because the structures of both layouts are quite different.
If they are too different, they can't be implemented within the same component, and we have to use two separate components.
I dislike doing this because it often results in a poor user experience.
If we ship two separate components, we have to hide one of them, and I see only two ways of doing this:

1. We ship the code for both to the client and hide one of them with CSS.
   The user should not see a layout shift, but we potentially ship a lot of unseen code to the client.
2. We use JavaScript on the frontend to determine the screen size and render the correct layout.
   However, this can result in a layout shift because the user sees the card layout first, and if the device is larger, the layout changes to the table layout.

I wanted to avoid both of these solutions and thought about a way to implement both layouts within the same component.
I came up with a solution that uses CSS Grid and CSS Subgrid.
Let me show you how I did it.

## The card layout

We start with the card layout.
I always like to start with the markup only.
This way, I can focus on clean and semantic HTML.
The card layout could be as follows:

```html
<div>

  <article>
    <h2>Type-safe environment with TypeScript and Zod</h2>
    <div>Sebastian Sdorra</div>
    <time>2023-08-22</time>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>Speeding up a serverless function</h2>
    <div>Sebastian Sdorra</div>
    <time>2023-08-13</time>
  </article>

</div>
```

If we create a React component for this layout, it could look like this:

```tsx
function Post({ title, author, date }: Props) {
  return (
    <article>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <div>{author}</div>
      <time>{date}</time>
    </article>
  );
}

function Posts({ posts }: Props) {
  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <Post key={post.id} {...post} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now we can use Tailwind to apply some styles to the layout.

```tsx
function Post({ title, author, date }: Props) {
  return (
    <article className="border rounded-xl shadow-md p-4 max-w-lg">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">{title}</h2>
      <div>{author}</div>
      <time>{date}</time>
    </article>
  );
}

function Posts({ posts }: Props) {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <Post key={post.id} {...post} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

You can imagine that this is a simplified version, and the real implementation is much more complex, but you get the idea.
We used the mobile-first approach here and implemented the card layout for mobile devices.
Now we want to implement the table layout for larger devices.

## The table layout

For the upgrade to the table, we use a technique called [Subgrid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Subgrid).
First, we make the parent element a grid container with three columns.

```tsx
function Posts({ posts }: Props) {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <Post key={post.id} {...post} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now we should see three cards in a row.
But this is not what we want; we want a table layout.
To achieve this, we have to span the `article` element over all three columns with `col-span-3`.
Now we are back to the layout we had before, one card per row.
But if we add `grid grid grid-cols-subgrid` to the article element, we can get an idea of how to implement the table layout.
We had to prefix our classes for the table layout with `md:`, so that they only apply to larger devices.
We also had to hide shadow and border for the card layout on the larger devices.

```tsx
function Post({ title, author, date }: Props) {
  return (
    <article className="col-span-3 max-w-lg rounded-xl border p-4 shadow-md md:grid md:grid-cols-subgrid md:rounded-none md:border-0 md:shadow-none">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">{title}</h2>
      <div>{author}</div>
      <time>{date}</time>
    </article>
  );
}

function Posts({ posts }: Props) {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 divide-y rounded-lg md:border md:shadow-md md:gap-y-0">
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <Post key={post.id} {...post} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

That is looking good, but a table layout should have a header row.

```tsx
function Posts({ posts }: Props) {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 divide-y rounded-lg md:border md:shadow-md md:gap-y-0">

      <header className="hidden col-span-3 p-4 md:grid md:grid-cols-subgrid font-semibold text-gray-500">
        <div>Title</div>
        <div>Author</div>
        <div>Date</div>
      </header>

      {posts.map((post) => (
        <Post key={post.id} {...post} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The header row is hidden on mobile devices and only visible on larger devices.
We also added some styles to the header row to make it look like a table header.

A sample implementation (HTML + Tailwind only) can be found [here](https://play.tailwindcss.com/nK7kwSFOjO).

## Conclusion

We started with a card layout for mobile devices and upgraded it to a table layout for larger devices.
We used CSS Grid and CSS Subgrid to implement both layouts within the same component.
This way, we avoided shipping two separate components to the client and avoided layout shifts.
I hope this technique helps you implement similar designs in the future.
